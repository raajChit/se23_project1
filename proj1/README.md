Our project which we tried to run was  "CheapBuy". It is a digital shopping assistant in the form of a web application. The primary goal of this web application was to simplify online shopping by offering users a platform where they could easily compare prices of a product across major online retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, and others. The project idea is a great one and as far as we tested it was working well as well. The convenience of not having to jump from one website to another in search of the best price is very appealing, and that is why this ideas is great when attempted successfully .Indeed, in an time where consumers are given so many choices, such tools can offer a lot of value by making the decision-making process more efficient and transparent. It's the convergence of technology and consumer demand for convenience that makes such innovations indispensable.

However, as we went deeper into the process of setting up and testing this particular project, we faced various problems. The first problem we encountered was the lack of clear instructions. For any software or application, especially one that is shared with a broader number of people or different teams, detailed setup instructions are required for better workings. The Git repository was missing a step-by-step guide on how to replicate the project. Without these detailed steps, users and developers can easily become lost and so did we. This lead to frustration and wasted time. It further confirmed the importance of detailed documentation that even a person unfamiliar with the project should be able to follow. In today's changing technological world, the user experience starts even before one interacts with the application itself. Thus, the onboarding process, which includes setting up and installation, plays a very important role in determining the user's overall impression of a project.

Next, we stumbled upon problems related to the requirements.txt file. This file mentions the dependencies which python3 requires; it essentially jots down all the software components the project needs to function correctly. We noticed that some of the software listed, specifically Flask and webdriver_manager, were outdated versions. Using outdated software can cause different problems – the outcome is unpredictable and often undesirable. It highlighted the importance of regularly checking and updating these components to ensure the smooth operation of the project. It's important to maintain a project, as it can very well lead to malfunction or, at the very least, suboptimal performance. In the digital world, outdated dependencies can expose the software to vulnerabilities, degrade performance, or make integration with other services a challenge.

Another challenge which we faced was the project's organization. As developers often split a project into different parts or files to make it more manageable, these parts need to be communicated without any issues. However,  in "CheapBuy", there seemed to be communication gaps between these parts. Our team attempted to rectify this by adding specific lines of code to the server_api.py file. The lines we added were “import os,  import sys,  sys.path.insert(0, os.getcwd())”. While this solution was effective, it made us realize the need for a well-structured project from the outside. Proper organization not only makes the development process smoother but also simplifies troubleshooting and future updates. Just as a well-organized library allows readers to find books efficiently, a well-structured software project ensures that developers can pinpoint issues, make updates, and onboard new team members with ease.

From this review, we learned several lessons and recommendations. First and foremost, clear instructions are very important. Whether it's for setup, troubleshooting, or general use, a well-documented guide can save users and developers a lot of hours of confusion. Secondly, software components must be regularly reviewed and updated. As a practice it is very important to ensure software compatibility. Developers should ensure they're using the latest and most compatible software versions for their projects. Lastly, taking the time to properly organize a project at the beginning can prevent a lot of issues down the line. In short, the foundation of any successful project lies not only in its concept but also in its execution. Attention to detail, good maintenance, and proper organization are important for building nice, efficient, and user-friendly applications.


In conclusion we would like to say, while "CheapBuy" showed a nice concept and had good potential in the online shopping space, there were clear gaps in the way it was executed. Our review of this project showed the importance of clear documentation, up-to-date software components, and a well-organized structure. These insights will be important for anyone trying to do similar projects in the future.
